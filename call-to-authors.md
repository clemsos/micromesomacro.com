## Call to Authors - Micro Meso Macro, the book

![](/uploads/book/book-rendering.jpg)

### After two fruitful editions in Lyon, time has come for our discussions to get out of the conference room and circulate across the wider world. *Micro Meso Macro* will now become a catalogue of the original works shown in Lyon.

### About the book

The book contains 200~ pages of bilingual (French & English) text, with large and abundant graphics - as such topic deserves. It will reflect the diversity of approaches and practices featured at the conference. The book is to be launched during an exhibition for the next edition of Micro Meso Macro.

You can read more about it on [the dedicated book page](/book).


### What is expected

For your contributions, there is two main ways. First, rework something based on your intervention during the conference. Second, propose something new from your more recent works or preoccupations.

Both are fine and welcome as long as your contribution stays on-topic i.e. along the lines of visual representation, graphic methods, cartography, data visualisation, design approaches, art practices, etc.

Texts will be kept short to give maximum resonance to the images, graphics and artworks that makes the real substance of the matter here. Original artworks and creations are of course particularly favoured. If you plan to reuse existing materials, please make sure you own the publishing rights.

### How to contribute

To submit your work, here are the requirements:

- a text in French or in English (1000-2000 words approx)
- a few hi-res images (300 dpi or more) with appropriate image rights
- your complete name with affiliation or credentials as you would like them to appear in the book
- a short bio (max 500 characters)

We will translate donc n’hésitez pas à écrire en français si vous voulez.

### The deadline you need

#### Please send your contributions at <clement@micromesomacro.com> before May 1st, 2020.

Many Thanks !

Clément Renaud
